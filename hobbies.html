  I use to do the decathlon and I still love staying in shape. I also love doing
  anything that lets me be with people such as tennis, volleyball, rock climbing,
  and whatever else I get invited to. If I don't have people to hang out with
  I'll usually just be lazy and stay home to play video games or bake something.
